# Overview

From December 3rd to 17th, I took part in the Solana Builders League, a hackathon focused on bringing the next billion users into the Solana ecosystem. Over the course of the two weeks, I attended workshops, worked with my team to brainstorm and ultimately create an MVP for our project, **Surf - a ChatGPT for smart contracts**. Despite many of my friends being on break, the hard work paid off as we were able to secure first place with our project.

# Metacamp

The hackathon is organized by Metacamp, a Solana-based educational platform and community. It boasts a web3-powered workspace — the first of its kind in Singapore — in the heart of Chinatown. The workspace served as the venue for the entire event and was designed with various sections for hot-desking, hosting workshops, and even a rooftop garden.

Participants were given access to the workspace and the expertise of the Metacamp co-founders.

# workshop

At the start of the hackathon, a four-day workshop was held covering topics such as Rust smart contract development, on-chain analytics, and an introduction to the Solana ecosystem.

The Solana blockchain architecture is significantly different from other EVM chains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon, which made it challenging for me to keep track of the differences. I had to work hard to grasp entirely new concepts like programs, instructions, the Solana Program Library, and Program Derived Addresses. Rust, the programming language used for smart contracts on Solana, is more complex than Solidity. Even with the use of the anchor framework to abstract away some of the low-level details, it was still a difficult task to write smart contracts in Rust.

Our instructor, Vincent, did an excellent job explaining difficult concepts in simpler terms and helped me understand concepts that I would not have grasped otherwise.

# Surf

Towards the end of the workshop, I was invited to join a group in need of someone with web3 and blockchain experience, which I happened to have. Their idea of an AI-powered assistant that generates smart contracts based on natural language prompts impressed me, and after joining the team, we further developed the concept and brainstormed new features to appeal to various demographics. We eventually named the project Surf.

Surf focuses on simplifying the process of writing smart contracts in Rust, a goal that aligns with the hackathon's aim of onboarding the next 1 billion users to the Solana ecosystem. It is an all-in-one platform with features such as curated educational resources for web3 and smart contract beginners, as well as a no-code smart contract deployment platform for business users. The standout feature of Surf is Surfboard, a smart IDE that uses ChatGPT to generate tens of thousands of hours' worth of smart contracts in seconds using Natural Language Processing. This will benefit both new and experienced developers in their smart contract development journey.

# Demo Day

On December 17th, we presented our projects to a panel of four experts with extensive web3 experience in their respective fields. Unfortunately, Julia was unable to attend.

There were nine teams presenting that day, each given three minutes for their presentation and two minutes for questions. The projects were diverse and covered a range of industries such as gaming, retail/ticketing, media/advertising, and more. It was a competitive hackathon with each team presenting innovative solutions that would benefit web3 users.

Our team was the last to present, and we were on edge as the previous teams set the bar high with their quality projects. One project that stood out to me was Own Your Content (OYC), which fell under the media/advertising category and aimed to solve the problem of clickbait in online journalism through decentralized monetization and NFT representation. Another notable project was Play2Earn, an sdk that adds web3 gamefi elements to existing web2 games.

Given the level of competition, we were thrilled to learn that we had won first place with our project, Surf. After a quick photo session, we celebrated the rest of the night with minigames and homemade mulled wine.

# Moving Forward

The hackathon was an enjoyable and immersive experience that opened my eyes to the Solana ecosystem. Although it only lasted two weeks, the takeaways were immense as I gained a lot of knowledge and made connections with many like minded individuals. I look forward to many more blockchain hackathons to come.
